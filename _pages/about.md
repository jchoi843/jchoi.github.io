Hi, I am Jaemoo Choi, a Postdoc in Georgia Tech.


I study <strong>fundamental algorithms for learning diffusion models with optimality structures</strong>. At Georgia Tech, I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2z7iDDUAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Yongxin Chen</a> and working with a group of incredible researchers. From September 2025, I am co-advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M-MfqpMAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Joonseok Lee</a>. Prior to that, I graduated with Ph.D. in Department of Mathematical Sciences and BS in Mathematic Education from Seoul National University.
