Hi! I’m <strong>Jaemoo Choi</strong>, a postdoctoral researcher at <strong>Georgia Tech</strong>.
My research focuses on the <strong>fundamental algorithms for generative AI (GenAI)</strong> and their applications across vision, language, and scientific domains (e.g., molecular generation). I am particularly interested in <strong>diffusion models, discrete diffusion, flow-based methods, and large language/vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs)</strong>.

At Georgia Tech, I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2z7iDDUAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Yongxin Chen</a> and to work with an outstanding group of researchers. Since September 2025, I have also joined <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M-MfqpMAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Prof. Joonseok Lee</a>’s group. Prior to that, I received my <strong>Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences</strong> and <strong>B.S. in Mathematics Education</strong> from <strong>Seoul National University</strong>.
